training_for_libraries
======================

A place for resources and teaching materials for the library community.

###Basic Idea
There are lots of resources for learning how to code online, but choosing, vetting, and commiting to one or a few resources is a process. This repo is meant to aggregate existing tools and curriculum geared toward librarians and para-professionals. The plan for MozFest, is to talk through those resources and build a fleshed-out [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.io/) that libraries can adopt and version for staff education. 

At the same time, we've identified a need for community around curriculum, and mentorship opportunities to motivate library learners; hosting on git aims to provide those kind of collaborative and parallel learning opportunities. Part of our session will involve brainstorming how best to broach that need. 

###General Curriculum
* [Library Data Science Curriculum](http://altbibl.io/dst4l/)
